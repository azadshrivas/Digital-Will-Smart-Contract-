# Digital Will Smart Contract

## 🧾 Project Description
The Digital Will Smart Contract is a decentralized inheritance solution built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to securely store digital assets and automatically transfer them to a designated beneficiary after a specified period — no intermediaries, no disputes.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To revolutionize legacy planning by enabling a self-executing, trustless digital will system that ensures individuals can pass on their digital wealth securely and transparently.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Time-locked Inheritance**: Assets are securely locked until the predefined release time.
- **Secure Fund Transfer**: Only the designated beneficiary can claim the inheritance after the lock period.
- **Beneficiary Update**: The owner can update the beneficiary before the release time.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- **Multi-Beneficiary Support**: Enable inheritance to be distributed among multiple parties.
- **Integration with Oracles**: Use external oracles to verify death certificates and automate will execution.
- **NFT and Token Support**: Extend support to ERC20 and ERC721 assets.
- **Emergency Reclaim**: Allow owners to reclaim assets in special circumstances before death.
